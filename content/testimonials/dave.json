  "body": "Richard is a great developer - incredibly knowledgeable in his field, and always ready to experiment and expand his horizons. In the time I worked with him at McCann, he was a great mentor to a number of other developers, and really worked to expand their knowledge and understanding. If I had a .Net team, I would hire Rich in an instant, and I can't really give any higher praise than that."
