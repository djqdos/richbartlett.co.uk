  "body": "Rich is a fantastic developer with an impressive work ethic. We worked together for the best part of 2 years at McCann and, more than anyone else I've worked with, he introduced me to new ideas, new concepts, and new ideas. When it came to innovating, or upgrading our offerings, Rich was always first to suggest a new idea or produce a proof of concept piece of work to see whether an idea would benefit us. He has a genuine interest in the product he puts out and also in the constantly evolving technical environment we exist in. I would highly recommend him highly to anyone."
